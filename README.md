# MIMO-OTFS-Communication-System
Authors: Marco Salvatori, Simone Catenacci

Final Project for "Elettronica per le Telecomunicazioni" (Universit√† di Roma "Tor Vergata")

The main goal of the project was to realize (and simulate) a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication system tha utilizes the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS), a 2D modulation technique that transforms the information carried in the Delay-Doppler coordinate system. It was first used for fixed wireless, and is now a contending waveform for 6G technology due to its robustness in high-speed vehicular scenarios.
This was accomplished (to a alrge extent) by creating a NtxNr MIMO system in MATLAB using the Input-Output relation defined in the book "Delay-Doppler Communications: Principles and Applications" by Yi Hong, Tharaj Thaj and Emanule Viterbo.
Furthermore, channel estimation was implemented and simulated.
